# DJ Slicer - Rhythm Game lıllılı.ıllı.ılılıı

Welcome to **DJ Slicer**!  A fun, single-player rhythm-based game built with React Native and Expo Go. Step into the shoes of a DJ, swipe along glowing lines in sync with your chosen song's beat, and keep the party going! Miss a swipe? Lose a life (you start with 3❤︎). Perfect for training your rhythm skills.

- **Platform**: Vertical orientation only – hold your phone upright!
- **Core Mechanic**: Swipe along the shown line on the vinyl to the song's rhythm. Fail, and it's one life down.
- **Tested On**: Primarily Android. Playable on iOS, but some features might cause crashes (like navigation during the gameplay).
- **Tech Stack**: React Native with Expo Go for easy development and testing.

## Installation

1. Install Expo Go on your mobile device (Android or iOS).
2. Clone this repo: `git clone `.
3. Navigate to the project: `cd DJSlicer`.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
5. Start the app: `npx expo start`.
6. Scan the QR code with Expo Go!
  -Tip: Make sure your mobile device is on the same Wi-Fi network as your computer

## Game Modes

Choose your vibe with these modes:

- **Training**ــــــــﮩ٨ـ   
  Practice the basics! One vinyl to experiment with swiping, tapping, and random line appearances. No pressure – just get the feel.

- **Normal**ــــــــﮩ٨ـ   
  Pick a song, swipe on vinyls as lines appear in rhythm. Nail it for 1 ⭐ per perfect slice. Survive with your 3 lives!

- **Loop**ــــــــﮩ٨ـ  (I'm working on it.)  
  The song loops and speeds up after each cycle. Rack up points for sliced vinyls – game over only when lives hit zero.

## Tips for Pro DJs

- **Thumb Position**: Hover your thumbs over the vinyl's center while gripping your phone.
- **Swipe Smart**: Start from the middle of the vinyl for speed (side swipes work but slow you down).
- **Quick Help**: Tap "How to Play" in-game for basics.
- **Have Fun!** Turn up the volume and lose yourself in the beat.
